What is an Unrolled Linked List?

An unrolled linked list is a variation of a linked list where each node contains an array of elements instead of just one element. 
This reduces the overhead caused by frequent allocations and deallocations in a standard linked list, 
as multiple elements can be stored in a single node.

Five Industry-Level Applications:
1). Cache Implementation :- It can be used to store cached data where quick access to blocks of data is important.
2). Text Editors :- In applications like text editors, where large amounts of data need to be stored and manipulated efficiently.
3). Memory Management :- Unrolled linked lists are used in memory allocation systems to handle and manage memory chunks efficiently.
4). Database Systems :- Database indexing and query engines often use data structures like unrolled linked lists to optimize memory usage and performance.
5). Graphics Rendering :- In computer graphics, unrolled linked lists are used for storing and processing vertices and other components in complex scenes efficiently.
